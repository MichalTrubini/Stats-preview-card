STUMBLING BLOCKS:

- Image overlay was problematic; solutions online suggested mainly to include both overlay and image in the background property, however doing that resulted in text being pushed up. At the end, image and overlay used as two blocks with absolute value.
- However this solution is not ideal because it forced me to give the overlay a fixed height.

WHAT IS TO BE USED/AVOIDED IN THE NEXT PROJECTS

- headings should starts with h1, not h2
- if several elements inside one block require margin/padding, use margin/padding on parent rather than each individual child
- BEM convention still messy; at the present moment however, no recommendations
